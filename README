	Generic Multi-Particle Correlations
	===================================

This code calculates the generic multi-particle correlator

	C{n} = <exp(i(sum_j^n h_j phi_j))>

where the vector h=h_1,...,h_n is the harmonics of each particle,
and phi_j is the observations of the azimuthal angle.

Building:
---------

To check out, do

	svn co https://svn.cern.ch/reps/alicefmd/mcorrelations/trunk mcorrelations

To build, do

	cd mcorrelations
        make

To run tests, do

	make test
        make Test

(Test requires ROOT)

To make the documentation (requires Doxygen), do

	make doc

Methods:
--------
The code implements:

      * correlations::closed::NestedLoops - direct loop calculations.
      * correlations::recursive::NestedLoops - loop calculations, using recursion.
      * correlations::closed::FromQVector - Calculation from Q-vector using fixed
        expression (up to 8-particle correlator defined).
      * correlations::recurrence::FromQVector - Calculation from Q-vector using
        combinatorics and recurrence
      * correlations::recursive::FromQVector - Calculation from Q-vector using
        recursion only.

See also the example correlations/progs/analyze.cc (and
correlations/progs/Analyze.C - the ROOT version).
